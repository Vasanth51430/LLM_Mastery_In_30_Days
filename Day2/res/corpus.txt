In the beginning, machines were designed to follow human instructions.
However, with the advent of artificial intelligence, machines have started learning on their own.
This corpus is a collection of sentences to train the BasicTokenizer.
Feel free to expand this file with more data to make the tokenizer better.
Natural language processing is the key to many AI-powered applications.
Tokenizers play a crucial role in transforming text into machine-readable formats.
Machine learning models often require text to be split into smaller chunks called tokens.
This process is essential in many NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, translation, and summarization.
By training a tokenizer, we can effectively break down sentences into meaningful units.
With more training data, the tokenizer becomes more efficient at handling complex sentences.
